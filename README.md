# VoiceAndSoundRecord by Richard Cook
Records Voice (mic) and Desktop Sounds. Designed as a simulator Cockput Voice Recorder but can be used for recording all inputs and outputs in a desktop computer.

# Purpose
This application has been designed to act as a Cockpit Voice Recorder for Flight Simulators to promote better communication and flying in the virtual world. It was designed for use in DCS
and using Discord and was trialed in Shadowlands Fast Jet Training School (https://www.patreon.com/timdavies) before release. 

This can be syncronised with Tacview (https://www.tacview.net/product/about/en/), which again promotes better debriefs.

# Use

When Record is hit, the programme records both desktop audio and the selected microphone audio into WAV format. These can then be mixe by pressing the Mix button. Further features are available as required.
